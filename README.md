# Spooned
Ever in the dilemma with your friends of not knowing what you want to eat?
Ever want to find out if new food places are nearby?
Just hungry 24/7?
*Start spooning!*

**Spooned** is an Android  app that features restaurants nearby your location (or some other location you may be interested in). Discover and explore new restaurants by "spooning" right or "knifing" left on the cards of restaurants.

Users can:
- tap on cards to look at a more detailed view of the restaurant (including rating, location, hours, and contact info)
- look through photos and reviews
- go back to previously spooned restaurants
- view a map of all the spooned restaurants
- share restaurants to Facebook

Go ahead and start [spooning](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=fbu.spooned)!
